# Data Structure Simulator

## Overview
The Data Structure Simulator is an educational JavaFX application designed to help users visualize and interact with various data structures and algorithms. It covers sorting algorithms, searching algorithms, stack operations, queue operations, and binary search tree (BST) operations. This intuitive interface and interactive features make it an excellent tool for learning and understanding the fundamental concepts of data structures.

## Features

### Main Menu
- **Enter**: Start learning and simulating algorithms.
- **Close**: Exit the application.

### Algorithm Selection Menu
- **Choose Algorithm**: Select from Sorting, Searching, Stack, Queue, or Binary Search Tree.
- **Back**: Return to the main menu.

### Sorting Algorithms
- **Adjustable Simulation Speed**: Use a slider to control the speed of the simulation.
- **Custom Input Size**: Select the size of the input array to sort.

### Searching Algorithms
- **Adjustable Simulation Speed**: Use a slider to control the speed of the simulation.
- **Custom Input Size**: Select the size of the input array to search.

### Stack Operations
- **Visualize Operations**: See push, pop, and peek operations in action.

### Queue Operations
- **Visualize Operations**: See enqueue and dequeue operations in action.

### Binary Search Tree (BST) Operations
- **Visualize Operations**: See insertion, deletion, and searching operations in action.
- **Traversal Buttons**: Display the results of preorder, postorder, and inorder traversals.
