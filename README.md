# Data Structure Simulator

## Overview
The Data Structure Simulator is an educational JavaFX application designed to help users visualize and interact with various data structures and algorithms. It covers sorting algorithms, searching algorithms, stack operations, queue operations, and binary search tree (BST) operations. This intuitive interface and interactive features make it an excellent tool for learning and understanding the fundamental concepts of data structures.

## Features

### Main Menu
- **Enter**: Start learning and simulating algorithms.
- **Close**: Exit the application.

### Algorithm Selection Menu
- **Choose Algorithm**: Select from Sorting, Searching, Stack, Queue, or Binary Search Tree.
- **Back**: Return to the main menu.

### Sorting Algorithms
- **Adjustable Simulation Speed**: Use a slider to control the speed of the simulation.
- **Sorting Selection**: Select any sorting algorithm from the drop down box. The available sorting algorithms are: Bubble sort, Selection sort, Merge sort, Heap sort, Quick sort and Insertion sort.
- **Custom Input Size**: Select the size of the input array to sort.
- **Shuffle**: Shuffle the present array.
- **Reset**: Generate a new array with random number of selected size.
- **Back**: Return to the algorithm selection menu

### Searching Algorithms
- **Adjustable Simulation Speed**: Use a slider to control the speed of the simulation.
- **Searching Selection**: Select any searching algorithm from the drop down box. The available sorting algorithms are: Linear search and Binary search.
- **Custom Input Size**: Select the size of the input array to search.
- **Shuffle**: Shuffle the present array.
- **Reset**: Generate a new array with random number of selected size.
- **Back**: Return to the algorithm selection menu

### Stack Operations
- **Visualize Operations**: See push and pop operations in action.
- **Message**: Message for popping from an empty stack.
- **Size**: Stack size and top element is shown at left control panel and updates in each simulation.

### Queue Operations
- **Visualize Operations**: See enqueue and dequeue operations in action.
- **Message**: Message for dequeueing from empty queue.
- **Size**: Queue size, front element and rear element is shown at top control panel and updates in each simulation.

### Binary Search Tree (BST) Operations
- **Visualize Operations**: See insertion, deletion, and searching operations in action.
- **Traversal Buttons**: Display the results of preorder, postorder, and inorder traversals as message.
